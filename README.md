- `R`: Location of your R code
  - `R/analyses`: Location of your R code for analyses
  - `R/functions`: Location of any custom R functions
  - `R/figures`: Location of your R code for producing figures
- `results`: Location of your results
- `article`: Location of your article files
- `figures`: Location of your figure files
  
Note: `.gitkeep` files have been generated for empty directories to enable repository structure. These may be removed.
